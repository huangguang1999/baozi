//! Transport-agnostic reconnect surface for remote `AppServerClient`s.
//!
//! Both the SSH (russh + WebSocket-over-tunnel) and Alleycat (Iroh QUIC)
//! transports need to be able to re-establish their underlying connection
//! and produce a fresh `AppServerClient` after a transient drop. This module
//! defines the small trait the session worker uses to drive that operation
//! without knowing which transport is underneath.
